This is a game for my final project in Exploring Fiction based off of the gothic literature novels read (Dracula, Frankenstein, Haunting of Hill House)

Ideas: could you use NLP to allow users to input text and automatically generate an output from a NPC

Maybe each script can be a different region of the game itself and can be called by main and take player as argument
